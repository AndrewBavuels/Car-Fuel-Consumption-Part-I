# **Car Fuel Consumption Part I - Analysis and Predictions 🚗📈🔮**

The goal for this project was to be more prepared for the next technical assessment as part of a selection process. Once more, I want show a case in which I will apply **advanced analytics** involving **data visualization** and **predictions with machine learning** regarding to Car Fuel Consumption.

## 1. Project description 👇
 
### _Part I: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Visualization with Python._
- Question #1: Which gas type consumes the most? E10 or SP98?
- Question #2: How much is the consumption?
- Question #3: It consumes 0.4 liters more with E10 gas, isn't it?


### _Part III: Predictions with Machine Learning._
- Do you have any hypothesis?
- Can you make any kind of prediction: regression and/or classification?

#### Storytelling

- What metrics are you obtaining?
- Explain your conclusions
- Shape your new data and conclusions in such a way that is appealing to the listener and tells a story

### Extra:
#### Enrich your dataset

- Add value: obtain related data by web scraping or with APIs.
- 
### _Part IV: Load the processed information into a database._

For this project I used a "Car Fuel Consumption" dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anderas/car-consume/). 
- First, I am going to get insights for the current status about how much is the consumption per each gas fuel type. After the data cleaning process, the output will be explored and saved in Tableau Public.
- Then, I am going to get more information to predict the consumption according to the features of the dataset, by getting the model training in Machine Learning.



<!-- ### Problems detected to solve are as follows:

- Complex issues and gaps that affect customer experience
- There is no assigned role structure for the identified problems
- No reporting system to communicate issues effectively to stakeholders
- Insufficient capacity to reply customer/user reviews -->


## **2. Technology stack 💻**

### Programming language:
- [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/)


### Python Libraries:
- [matplotlib.pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html): For data visualization.
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/archive/0.11/index.html): For data visualization.
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/): For mathematical operations and array manipulation.
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html): For data manipulation and analysis.
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): For machine learning data predictions.

<!-- ### Functional architecture design:

<!-- ## **3. Minimal Functional Product ⚙️**

- Notebook with the code that processes the dataset, from its Data Cleaning to the Area Classification, **described in the Functional architecture design**. 
- Dashboards for both Issues & Satisfaction Management uploaded to Tableau Public, containing the visualizations created from the processed dataset. **The link is found in the Demo as main.txt file**

### Dashboards previews:

- Issues Management: Dashboard from Negative Reviews

- Satisfaction Management: Dashboard from Positive Reviews

    > *"I named this dashboard Spotiliebers (a parody term from Justin Bieber Fans) referring to Spotify Users Support, in order to give a fresh touch to this project".*

## **5. Next steps 💡**

- Develop an action plan to address problem areas identified in the 80-20
- Establish a multidisciplinary team with clearly defined roles to address the problem areas identified in the 80-20
***
- Automate the connection with new data in the reporting system
- Integrate other data formats such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, JSON, XML
